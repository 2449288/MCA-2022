# **Title and Introduction**

**Theme:  I will be looking at Vivaldi's Violin Concertos, specifically, Vivaldi's Four Seasons**

## Vavaldi (1678 - 1741)
>Vavaldi's Violin Concertos, specifically _Il Cimento dell'Armonia e dell'Inventione_ translated as _The Contest between Harmony and Invention_ (Op. 8, published in 1725) **This peice is more commonly known for it's first four movements - the four seasons.**  


# Week 1
*Task: Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? 
How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? 
Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.*
### Challenges
There are many challenges when working with music and music-related data. While there are many data-bases available storing and describing vast amounts of music data, from Sheet Music Library's such as IMSLP/Muse Score, to Digital libraries such as Spotify, there are limitations to music and storing data.

Looking at sheet music databases, while the information on these sights can be analysed for data on the title, composer, quality of said data - a lot of the data is stored as photos or as audio samples. It required a secondary element such as a human to them turn that photo into understanding the music. If you can even call it music in that pure form. Another challenge that is present perhaps specifically in music-related data that Spotify might use, is there is minimal context to the data they collect. Other than the information on the song, and perhaps basic data on the listener, there is no information on the mood of the listener or why they are listening to X or Y, which could impact the data being produced.

The most obvious example is in relation to live performance. Whilst technology can produce near-perfect examples of music, the uniqueness that live performance brings is something that can never be truly replicated. The musicality that comes with playing a peice live is hard to record in data form. This is perhaps most clear when comparing playback from a music software (such as Sibelius) to a live performance, but arguably also recorded music, even if the recording itself is from a live performance. There will always be aspects from the atmosphere and performance that are not captured or have limited ability to be demonstrated in recorded music.


### How does Vivaldi's Violin Concertos display these challenges?
Being a such a renowned peice of music, there are plenty of recordings and notation of Vivaldi’s Violin Concertos available in a simple google search. The question of a live performance is valid here. String instruments are complex instruments to play, and with many subtle performance techniques, each performance is completely unique (even if from an untrained ear they sound identical). Music-data cannot reproduce what techniques are used and distinguish these subtleties that live performances can. 

Another challenge that applies to Vivaldi's Violin Concertos is that the popularity of his works means there are vast amounts of recordings and music online, and it is often hard to tell exactly who published everything and if the recordings were official or not. The databases can provide some information here, but cannot examine the authenticity of the recording themselves, and we are reliant on the supposed factual information given to us by the author or uploaded of said material on the data base.

### Data and Vivaldi's Violin Concertos
Vivaldi's Violin Concertos and in fact Baroque music as a genre has multiple platforms in which it exists. It is curated in the simplest form using its Opus number, a number which is unique to the work itself allowing any database to identify it.

Vivaldi’s Violin Concertos score can be found in many sheet music library's, with many forms, adaptions and variations on the original. Most Baroque pieces have been carefully copied and printed from original manuscripts and reproduced for the masses, becoming commercially democratised and used by many from professional orchestras to individuals how they wish.

Vivaldi, being seen as an important figure and composer, being classified as part of the first Viennese School of composers, alongside Mozart and Beethoven, have been rigorously studied and who's works for many forms part of their basic musical education. Their pieces are scrutinised for certain theoretical techniques and practices that are considered vital by many for understanding Western-European classical music and therefore some under academic scholarly review constantly. Most recently now in relation to White supremacy and decolonisation, sparking new debates on the hierarchical, high-brow view of certain composers and genres in music and music education.
  

# Week 2 
*Task: Download and edit a peice of music on musescore from OMR technology.*

### Observations
The initial OMR technology was pretty accuratate, specifically in terms of notes, pitches and rhythms. 
Key elements missing: Metadata such as title, composer etc.  Tempo markings and instrumentation (thought violin was a voice) 
Alterations:  had to change instruments to a  voice and then copy and paste the material onto the new staves, still the staves were not braced the same as the original, had to spend a bit of time discovering how to brace the staves properly.  The mothod I found that worked was by adding in a piano stave which is already braced then changing the cleffs to the correct forms, however this may cause an issue in playback as the computer may think the sound is still a piano rather than a voice.  Perhaps the editorials functions in Musweascore are limited, perhaops this is due to  my own persoinal lack of knopwlegde of musescore, but overall, whilst the presentation may be correct, the further element of if the music created from musescore out of the PDF was played allowed would it have the desired effect the sheet music presented?  Not in the iniitial case of the OMR, it requitred user intervention to alter the sounds.  There is also a question of aaesthetic or practicality here in the limitations of musescore.  (e.g. braced staves or accurate sounding instrumentation!)

# Week 3
*TASK:  In the space provided on the verovio.html page, compare 3 elements in the MusicXML file to the corresponding ones in MEI. Think about: which attributes can be employed in each standard, which parents and children can be used, and try to think of the implications of these differences.* 

[`MEI file`](https://github.com/2449288/MCA-2022/blob/master/data/fourseasons.mei) // [`XML File`](https://github.com/2449288/MCA-2022/blob/master/data/four%20seasons.musicxml) //
[`Veroivo File`](https://github.com/2449288/MCA-2022/blob/master/verovio.html)


# Week 4
*TASK: 1. Generate a jSymbolic analysis of your piece. Be sure to export your piece as a MIDI file before trying to run jSymbolic, and select a group of features that you think is most interesting and relevant to your particular piece.
2. Use the Python notebook on the Moodle to generate a piano roll and pitch histogram of your piece using music21.*

# Week 5
*TASK: 1. Create a metadata schema by listing the elements (or a subset of at least 5 elements) that your group chose back on Tuesday.
2. Modify your MEI document according to the schema that you have created. Where possible, enrich your data by linking it to existing authorities as discussed in yesterday’s lecture using the @auth.uri attribute. Be sure to follow the MEI metadata standards (https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/metadata.html) for structuring your MEI header.*

 **Metadata schema**
1.	Title
2.	subtitle
3.	Composer
4.	Date
5.	Copyright

# Week 7



# Week 8
  
  
***Task 1: Find and describe 3 audio tracks relating to your theme**
1.	Identify and download 3 music tracks relating to your theme. Ideally, these should be different in their sound and style.
2.	Identify and list (in a table) the most important technical and non-technical metadata associated with each track. 
  
  
  
  
**Task 2: Perform basic analysis of your 3 tracks in SonicVisualizer**
1.	For each downloaded track, generate a spectrogram (with log-spaced frequency scale) in SonicVisualizer.
2.	Export the waveform and spectrogram in an image format for your GitHub portfolio.
3.	In 200 words (max), describe at least one advantage of a time-frequency analysis over a waveform-based analysis. Provide at least one example of the identified advantage by referencing a specific subpart of the output from step*
