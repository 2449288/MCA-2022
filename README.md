Theme:  I will be looking at Vivaldi's Violin Concertos.  

## Vavaldi (1678 - 1741)
Vavaldi's Violin Concertos, specifically _Il Cimento dell'Armonia e dell'Inventione_ translated as _The Contest between Harmony and Invention_ (Op. 8, published in 1725) 

# Week 1
Task: Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? 
How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? 
Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.
## Challenges
There are many challenges when working with music and music-related data.  While there are many data-bases available storing and descibing vast amounts of music data, from Sheet Music Library's such as IMSLP/Musecore, to Digital libraries such as Spoitfy, there are limitations to music and storing data.  
Looking at sheet music databases, while the information on these sights can be analaysed for data on the title,composer, quality of said data - a lot of the data is stored as photos or as audio samples.  It required a secondary element such as a human to them turn that photo into undertsanding the music.  If you can even call it music in that pure form. 
Another challenge that is present perhaps specifically in music-related data that Spotify might use, is there is minimal context to the data they collect. Other than the information on the song, and perhaps basic data on the listener, there is no information on the mood of the listener or why they are listeneing to x or y, whihc could impact the data being produced.  
The most obvious example is in relation to live performance. Whilst technology can produce near-perfect examples of music, the uniqueness that live performance brings is something that can never be truely replicated.  The musicality that comes with playing a peice live is hard to record in data form. This is perhaps most clear when comparing playback from a music software (such as Sibelious) to a live performance, but arguably also recorded music, even if the recording itself is from a live perfromance.  There will always be aspects from the atmosphere and performance that are not captured or have limited ability to be demonstated in recorded music. 

## How does Vivaldi's Violin Concertos display these challenges?
Being a such a reknowned peice of music, there are plenty of recordings and notation of Vivald's Violin Concertos available in a simple google search.  The question of a live performance is vaild here. String instruments are complex instruments to play, and with many subtle performance techniques, each performance is completely unique (even if from an untrained ear they sound identical).  Music-data cannot reproduce what techniques are used and distinquish these subtleties that live performances can. 
Another challenge that applies to Vivaldi's Violin Concertos is that the popularity of his works mean there are vast amounts of recordings and music online, and it is often hard to tell exactly who published everything and if the recordings were official or not.  The data-bases can provide some information here, but cannot examine the authenticity of the recording themselves, and we are reliant on the supposed factual information given to us by the author or uploaded of said material on the data base.

## Data and Vivaldi's Violin Concertos
Vivaldi's Violin Concertos and in fact Baroque music as a genre has multiple platforms in which it exists.  It is curated in the simplist form using its Opus number, a nuber which is unique to the work itself allowing any database to identify it.
Valvaldi's Violin Concertos score can be found in many sheet music library's, with many forms, adaptions and variations on the original. Most Baroque peices have been carefull copied and printed from original manuscripcs and reproduced for the masses, becoming comercially democritised and used by many from profesional orchestras to individuals how they wish.  
Valvaldi, being seen as a important figure and composer, being classified as part of the first Vienesse School of composers, alongside Mozart and Beethoven, have been rigiously studied and who's works for many form part of their basic musical education.  Their peices are scrutinised for certain theoretical techniques and practices that are considered vital by many for understanding Western-European classical music and therfroe some under academic scholarly review constantly.  Most recently now in relation to Whilte supremancy and decoloisation, sparking new debates on the hierarchical, high-brow view of certain composers and genres in music and music education.
